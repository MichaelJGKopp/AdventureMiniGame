Intro
His village in peril, the old man goes on an adventure to find arcane objects that could help him. During his journey our hero in the making hears about a rumored magical diamond in the south east and sets immediately out.
As such a perilous journey begins meeting mysterious creatures, companions, enemies and scenic landscapes.
The goal almost in sight, his travels continue until he can grasp the object and hopefully return to his village with nothing more than a few scratches.


Description

A simple text-based adventure game for the console.
The player who controls the hero moves one tile per round until the lower right corner with the diamond is reached and the game is completed.

Requirements
A computer on the level of a DCI notebook or a next generation DOS emulator would do just fine, who knows even a game boy might be enough?
Features
Map
The map can be randomly generated, saved to or loaded from a text file.
Anyone can also edit the text file to create your own maps. The letter represents the short name of the environment/tile as seen next.


Environment/Tiles
The data for tiles, names, descriptions and symbols are placed in a text file.
Come up with and create your own story/environments and place them in the text file!
Tiles are being randomly loaded if you generate a map or as described you can also deliberately place them.

Expand on the universe of Adventure FX Ultimate
Implement player stats, leveling, items, equipment, a shop and … MONSTERS!!
Alternatively change it to a pokemon clone.
THE GAME is only limited by your imagination!

I hope you enjoyed the presentation and saved a princess or two while you are at it. 
See you when Adventure FX Ultimate II (aka Pokemon Clone in Space) comes out!! Until then!
